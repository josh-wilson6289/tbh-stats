## Overview
Every sports league should have it's own stats page, and this Austin-based ball hockey league is no exception. But hosting all these stats in a Google Doc has it's limitations.  This app takes the entirety of Texas Ball Hockey's data and migrates it to it's own database. All the stats are displayed in a user-friendly, sortable table. Finally, bragging rights for most career goals and lowest goals against average is settled in just a single mouse click!
